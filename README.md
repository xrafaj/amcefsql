# AMCEF API MicroService Python 

It is important to have either running or setup database firstly. 
I have tested Postgresql14 with pgAdmin4 where I created simple database
with name amcefsql and password 'supersecretpass' and root user is postgres.

## Understanding and running the code

You can run whole app within Python 3.9 with standard main, no need for 
any commands to run the application.

Basic button interface on localhost (127.0.0.1:5000) offers you only one button click on

This is everything you need for first setup and you can start using. However,
I recommend using a Postman to test POST, DELETE, GET, PATCH and other kind 
of requests as my interface only supports POST and GET ones.
